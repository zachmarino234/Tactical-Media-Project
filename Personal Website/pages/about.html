        Hi! My name is Zach Marino and I am a second year computer science and
        design student at Northeastern University. I'm from Highland Park,
        Illinois but I was born in Philadelphia (go phils!).
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        As both a computer science and design student, I get the opportunity to
        not only design but code the projects I am passionate about. I am
        concentrating in interaction design which has given me a strong skillset
        using tools like Balsamiq and Figma, as well as a general affinity for
        the UI/UX design process. In the software world, this translates to a
        unique perspective on the software design process which you would not
        see from a typical developer.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        After class I am involved in multiple clubs on campus. First and
        foremost I am a product lead for Northeastern Electric Racing, our
        school's F1 team. We have an in-house project management web app called
        <a href="https://finishlinebyner.com/login">FinishLine</a>
        made in Typescript and React which I contribute design work to and
        manage other designers. I am also on the E-board for the Musicheads
        club, where we talk about and listen to music every week. We are
        currently in the process of becoming an official club.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        In my free time, I like listening to music, watching new movies, working
        on art projects, and watching baseball!
