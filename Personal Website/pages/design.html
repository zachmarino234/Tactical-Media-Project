        Shuffle is an iOS flashcard app which features a generative AI flashcard
        set creator. I worked on this project with Aaryan Jain and Zindagi
        Kamra. They coded the project while I prototyped the front end and
        developed all of the visual design like the logo and color scheme. This
        project was more so about learning Figma and developing my skills as a
        designer so we did not do any formal user testing or research, besides
        showing the prototype to family members. This was my first project using
        Figma so I was learning how to use it in the process of making this
        prototype.

        Over the summer, I took a special experience design class that was
        offered at Northeastern's Seattle campus. Throughout that class, we
        worked on a project with the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI),
        where they asked us to design a solution that improves the user
        experience of their Indigenous People's exhibit. Our group designed a
        web solution that provides text, audio, and videos related to different
        parts of the exhibit. We were pretty fast and loose about the user
        research and sketching because the class duration was shorter than a
        full semester but it was a good learning experience for conducting user
        research in the future. I am personally not a fan of Axure RP compared
        to Figma but it was still a good learning experience for general UI
        design.
