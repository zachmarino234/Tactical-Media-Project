This is my tactical media project for Experience and Interaction (ARTF 2223)

My project is a Geocities-inspired website called The Cool Corner which depicts the shutting down of Geocities and the thoughts accompanying someone with a Geocities site. It represents a random Geocities page with a couple of links and a homepage. The website is purposely vague because the details of the website aren’t important so much as the form itself is. This project is all digital using images from the internet and coded by myself. 

I decided to do a digital project because I am interested in coding and wanted to explore webpage creation and javascript scripting. As well, the concept is purely digital so making a physical project would have worked but would have to be very well justified in its form. Growing up using the internet, I have always been interested in the early 2000s internet that I never got to experience firsthand, and I wanted to explore that world more closely with this project. Archived Geocities sites and recreations influenced my formal choices for the home page. The purpose of this website is to show the collapse of Geocities metaphorically and the emotions that accompany it. The home page has a humorous tone despite the rest of the site having a hopeless tone because I wanted to show the juxtaposition of the site being “business as usual” despite the service shutting down. The links in the nav bar represent dead links that redirect to something other than what would actually be in those links. I wanted to add an interactive element to my website so that people could engage with the form so I used javascript to create functions that place images on click, place images at random positions every second, and track keystrokes (purely to check code input it does not keep any data and only tracks specific keys). I want my audience to understand the panic and hopelessness someone might have felt hearing their own little corner of the internet was getting shut down.
